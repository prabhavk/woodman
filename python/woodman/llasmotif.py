# a thought experiment to select significant digits of log likelihood scores
# 1) store log likelihood with a large precision (default 24)
# 2) compute a motif as if you were creating a consensus of TATA box like promoter sequences
# 3) significant digits of log likelihood score will appear as a conserved sequence motif
# 4) insignificant digits will be noise where each digit occurs with equal probability
